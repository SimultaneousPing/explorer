## Information

explorer is an archive of Roblox Corporation's Explorer, which is used in Roblox Studio as a core plugin. I managed to get the source code for the Explorer by downloading Roblox files straight off of Amazon AWS. However, Roblox does not store the files on the main branch of Studio. I managed to find it off of sitetest2 branch, you may have different results.

## Warning

This was intended to be a Studio plugin. As such, it should only run in Studio and NOT on the Roblox game client. As well as that, this is intended to be ran under RobloxScriptSecurity context. So things in the plugin such as GetFastFlag may not work as intended. You can fork the source and edit it to work though. I will not do it though.

## What's included?

Included in this repository is the source code for Roblox's Explorer. For any of those who would like the .rbxm file related to this, I have one added. Also, Roblox MIGHT change the related directories for this. So, be careful in case. 

Enjoy!
